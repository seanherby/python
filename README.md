# python
Welcome to Sean's python playground

I have created a few simple apps in here as I learned Python.

* [Dice Game](/source/dice_game.py) - You and a friend both roll dice and the program tells you who wins
* [Loan](/source/loan.py) - This tells you how much you stil owe for your mortgage
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors](/source/rock_paper_scissors.py) - This will keep playing rock paper scissors with you forever
* [Weather](/source/weather.py) - Connects to a weather service and shows you the forecast for your requested area

Instructions
To run Weather you will need to 
1. install the requests module:
 ```
 pip install requests
 ```
2. Get an account key from https://openweathermap.org/api\
3. Paste your account key into the Weather code instead of `your_code`
